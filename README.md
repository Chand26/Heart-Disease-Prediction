# Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression 

Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression is a machine learning project 
focused on predicting the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients. Heart 
disease is a major global health issue and one of the leading causes of death, emphasizing 
the importance of early diagnosis and prevention strategies. 

The project utilizes logistic regressionâ€”a classification algorithm ideal for binary 
outcomes - to analyze medical data from the Framingham Heart Study. The dataset includes 
over 4,000 patient records with features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, glucose 
levels, smoking habits, and gender. 

By training a logistic regression model on this data, the project aims to identify individuals 
at risk of developing CHD. The ultimate goal is to support healthcare professionals in 
making timely, data-driven decisions, thereby improving early detection and patient 
outcomes.
